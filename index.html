## Summary

Front-end & Computer Vision engineer with a broad experience in solving various problem types starting from standard web & mobile applications using React, ending with high-performance computations, graphic engines development, computer vision pipelines setup, etc. Have rich experience in 2D/3D graphics and games, managing datasets, training and evaluating models, and efficiently applying them to solve business problems. Worked and extended large-scale projects and monorepos and can navigate through large codebase with sophisticated architecture.

As a co-founder of a startup and contributor to product companies, I've had the opportunity to not only develop but also take full ownership of complex systems and features, investigate problems and markets, drive projects from idea to execution, prepare system design, gather requirements and collaborate with the right teams to ensure optimal results.

## Working Experience

### Memories Design (2021/03 - Present)

**Role: Co-founder, Front-end, Computer Vision Engineer**

Photo Album Creator Web Application startup. Generate and print albums with users photos. Automatic making layout, removing duplicates, bad photos, smart crop using AI-based image processing algorithms.

* Work with analytics, decision making and global planning, user behavior, and market research to guide a project and the business;
* Developed 70% of the React UI with Server Side Rendering and the main architecture of the front-end part;
* Set up machine learning infrastructure and trained CNN models to achieve 95% accuracy in image labeling, detect duplicates and segment photos for smart crop, and integrated a pipeline on client side (browser) with performance of 2000 images per minute;
* Led customer support, collected and processed feedback, and implemented improvements of the service and the final book quality.
* Managed localization and GDPR compliance, expanding the project to 150+ countries and 4 languages with CEO optimizations;

### Evolution (2023/10 - Present)

**Role: Front-end, Graphics, Computer Vision Engineer**

Web and Mobile games company working with live video streaming, 2D/3D graphics, machine learning and other cutting edge technologies.

* Led the design and development of a particle system engine and spawner with WebGL, Canvas and Pixi renderers and editor for designers, reducing animation costs and development time by 2-3 times;
* Researched and integrated a video recognition pipeline using YOLO8 and OpenCV into a microservice that automates and saves a dealer up to 10 seconds per game round;
* Authored technical documentation and delivered presentations on technical initiatives, participated in company hackathons;
* Participated in a company-wide, flexible bootstrap project that cut game development time from 1-2 days to 1 hour by researching and standardizing code, tools, architecture, and environment. This reduced long-term development and support costs for new games.

### WANNA x Farfetch (2021/06 - 2022/06)

**Role: Front-end, Graphics, Computer Vision Engineer**

Virtual AR Try-on Web Application. Try-on different clothes and accessories in a browser using camera stream, computer vision and 3D models in real-time.

* Transformed the try-on flow/logic to support new product types with their NN models and pipelines expanding the app auditory (watches try-on, 3d viewer, etc);
* Developed a tunable React UI and SDK packages with full documentation and automated package distribution on CDN for our clients;
* Boosted app and pipeline performance by 12%, worked with analytics, testing and supporting different browsers (WeChat, Facebook, etc).

### Instinctools & iTechArt Group (2018/10 - 2021/06)

**Role: Front-end, Mobile Engineer**

Outsourcing, Healthcare Applications. Web and mobile applications for clinics, doctors, researchers and patients. Integration of medical standards (FHIR, etc).

* Led the development of iOS and Android apps, designed architecture, implemented Bluetooth connectivity with medical devices.
* Collaborated with a 20+ people team, was in charge of different applications parts or full applications, built UI-kit packages with CI/CD;
* Initiated a large-scale house-selling project, defining architecture and tech stack.
* Worked with many different business-clients and their unprepared requirements, planned sprints, mentored developers.
