## Summary

Front-end & Computer Vision engineer with a broad experience in solving various problem types starting from standard web & mobile applications using React, ending with high-performance computations, graphic engines development, computer vision pipelines setup, etc. Have reach experience in 2D/3D graphics and games, managing datasets, training and evaluating models, and effectively applying them to solve business problems. Worked and extended huge projects and monorepos and can navigate through large codebase with sophisticated architecture.

As a co-founder of a startup and contributor to product companies, I've had the opportunity to not only develop but also take full ownership of complex systems and features, investigate problems and markets, drive projects from idea to execution, prepare system design, gather requirements and collaborate with the right teams to ensure optimal results.

## Working Experience

### Memories.Design (2021/03 - Present)

**Co-founder, Front-end, Computer Vision Engineer**

Photo Album Creator Web Application. My startup to generate and print albums with usersâ€™ photos. Automatic making layout, removing duplicates, not photos, auto crop ([link](https://memories.design/)). Working in 150 countries, using AI features and modern algorithms.

* Work with analytics, decision-making and planning, user behavior and research the market;
* Developed 70% of the UI and the main architecture of the front-end part;
* Prepared a Machine Learning infrastructure, worked and trained CNNs models to detect image labels, implemented a Computer Vision flow of several ML models in the front-end with 95% accuracy and good performance;
* Proposed and designed a performant algorithm to detect duplicate photos to hide them;
* Album quality is much better and conversion is 200% for users with processing compared with users without.
* Worked with GDPR, markets policies and localization - prepared and started the project in 150+ countries.
* Integrated full application localization system on 4 languages with CEO optimizations.

### Evolution (2023/10 - Present)

**Front-end, Graphics, Computer Vision Engineer**

A a veteran games design company for Web and Mobile working with live video streams games, 2D and 3D games, machine learning and other cutting edge technologies.

* Led, designed an architecture, developed and owned a particle system engine and editor for it which significantly decrease preparing, integrating and supporting complex animations in games - it saves weeks of developers time, and reduce 2-3 times graphical effects costs for the company;
* Researched, made and integrated a video recognition pipeline from camera stream using YOLO8 model and OpenCV as a microservice and connected with the game flow - automation manual process of detecting which saves 5-10 seconds on each game round;
* Developed an internal bootstrap project for different games, starting with Live games with video translation and sync and ending with pure random 2D games;
* Participated in games development process, developed assets managing and branding and other helping tools to speed up the workflow and save developers time providing more non-developer tools;
* Prepared and supported complex projects documentation for developer teams and non-developers in the company, made presentations of the team and my projects to other;

### WANNA x Farfetch (2021/06 - 2022/06)

**Front-end, Computer Vision Engineer**

Virtual AR Try-on Web Application. Try-on different clothes and accessories in a browser using camera stream, computer vision and 3D models in real-time ([link](https://webar.wanna.fashion/watch/))

* Refactored initial Try-on logic worked only for sneakers and integrated new product types with their NN models and pipelines, including watches;
* Developed a tunable React UI and SDK packages with full documentation and automated package distribution on CDN for our clients;
* Boosted app and pipeline performance by 12%, worked with analytics, testing and supporting different browsers (WeChat, Facebook, etc).

### Instinctools & iTechArt Group (2018/10 - 2021/06)

**Mobile and Front-end Engineer**

Outsourcing, Healthcare Applications. Web and mobile applications for clinics, doctors, researchers and patients. Integration of medical standards (FHIR, etc).

* Led the development of iOS and Android apps, designed architecture, integrated Bluetooth connectivity with medical devices.
* Collaborated with a 20+ people team, was in charge of different applications parts or full applications, built UI-kit packages with CI/CD;
* Initiated a large-scale house-selling project, defining architecture and tech stack.
* Worked with many different business-clients and their unprepared requirements, planned sprints, mentored developers.
